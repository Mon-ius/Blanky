## Joining Blankly

In preparation for my interview for Blankly I browsed the [Blankly website](https://blankly.finance) to familiarize myself with the company and what my role would possibly look like. I scrolled to a section entitled [‘Meet our growing core team’](https://blankly.finance/about) and saw nine headshots smiling at me from my screen– they were all men, a normal sight to see for a FinTech environment. During my interview, one of the last questions I was asked was how I would feel about being the only girl at the company. I laughed because I had wondered if there would be any mention of the topic, but I was happy to answer that I was really excited at the prospect of bringing some diversity into the work environment, something that is very much needed across all finance and technology workplaces.
Being the first female at the company has given me an opportunity to join the [leagues of women](https://thefinancialtechnologyreport.com/the-top-25-women-leaders-in-financial-technology-of-2021/) advancing themselves into male dominated fields, who prove everyday that women are just as capable as men, if not more, of excelling in finance and tech driven fields.

That being said, individually, tech and finance are very challenging fields to break into as a female. Combine both fields and you are at the hub of both of these male-dominated arenas, which are sculpted to support and propel men, while women continue to be shut out.
Today, only 30% of the FinTech workforce is made up of women and on average only [19% of FinTech companies are led by women](https://www.centerforfinancialinclusion.org/including-women-in-inclusive-fintech). While these are certainly improved statistics from previous years, there are still undoubtedly systemic flaws in the industry and society in general that create barriers to entry for women into FinTech and other similar fields. However, with FinTech growing exponentially at the moment, this is a very promising time for women to enter the field and change these statistics.

## My take on Females in FinTech

More females in FinTech = more equality and better opportunities for all women.

FinTech needs more females because if we ever want to reach economic gender equality, we need to have a better gender ratio in the processes that define that equality. Since FinTech has a large impact on economic growth, and therefore also affects the wages and benefits allocated to women in the workplace, having more women working in FinTech roles would allow us to more quickly make advancements towards economic gender equality both in FinTech and outside the field– in society in general.

[Countless studies](https://www.bostonfed.org/-/media/Documents/nerr/section4a.pdf) have shown that workplaces become more productive as women enter them. This leaves no doubt that the FinTech industry will flourish as more women enter the field and are promoted to leadership positions within the field. It’s a win-win situation: as more females enter, the industry grows, as does the momentum we have been generating towards closing the gender gap.

Having more women in FinTech generates this growth in momentum in two main ways:
First, consider how having more females inside of FinTech affects the women on the user side. [Dora Ziambra](https://www.altfi.com/article/8341_getting-more-women-into-fintech-challenges-and-opportunities), COO at Azimo, makes a solid point in acknowledging that “as women represent 50% of the population and potential FinTech users, we need to be focusing on how women can build unique financial products”. FinTech companies that are committed to improving user’s lives and experiences like [Blankly](https://blankly.finance/why-us), which focuses on making trading algorithms and quantitative finance accessible to more people, can create financial service opportunities for people that statistically face more challenges to experience economic benefits and growth. This includes women who, plagued by gender inequality, are often shut out of potential economic opportunities that default to men. Undoubtedly, FinTech products and services produced by females would serve women who may be shut out from using them due to an unconscious bias.

Additionally, cultivating a larger network of women in FinTech would encourage a surge of support and community among women in the field which would quickly translate to similar fields and eventually the rest of society because of how rapidly growing and important FinTech is right now. Overall, having more women in FinTech not only grows the industry, but also provides better opportunities for all women.

## Females are the Future

If you are a female thinking of entering the FinTech world, do not hesitate. 
Firstly, FinTech has a variety of opportunities to explore, some more finance oriented, others more tech oriented, and many being a balance of both. For example, at Blankly I have taken up the role of a Developer Advocate in which I work on company marketing with a technical focus by creating our [TikTok content](https://www.tiktok.com/@blanklyfinance) and writing blog articles. If you have any experience with either field, you are an asset in FinTech and it’s time to take action on that.

FinTech is hot right now and growing fast, with [3 out of 4 people worldwide](https://financesonline.com/fintech-statistics/) having used at least one FinTech process in some way. This makes it a great space to invest your time, energy, and value in, whether you are an expert or novice.

Lastly, FinTech needs women right now more than ever. Whether this means working a FinTech job, or educating yourself in finance and technology in order to be part of the FinTech space, there is a lot of room for women in this field. In order to close the gender gap in a male-dominated world, we need to grab at opportunities for large-scale change, and FinTech right now is within reach. There are plenty of resources females can make their start with such as [Girls who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) and [Girls who Invest](https://www.girlswhoinvest.org/) that will provide you with the skills you need and an inspiring community. I also recommend trying to connect with women in FinTech to hear what they have to say about their experience and what advice they have to offer. These women will be more than happy to support another female in FinTech and these connections will add to the foundation of the female FinTech community that we are building.

## Final Thoughts

Countless times I have sat in a meeting led by men or made up mostly of men or worked in a group project where I was the only female. Often in these situations there is a condescending thought in the back of my mind of ‘Am I saying the right thing?’, ‘Am I being heard and understood?’, ‘Should I explain myself more?’ and I’m sure most women have shared a similar experience. In these situations my mind always returns to one of my [favorite quotes](https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/maggie-kuhn/#:~:text=Stand%20before%20the%20people%20you,And%20do%20your%20homework.%E2%80%9D): 
<blockquote>“Speak your mind – even if your voice shakes”, spoken by Maggie Kuhn,</blockquote> which reminds me of the power I hold as a female that, when harnessed, surpasses all self-doubt and has the potential to “topple giants”.

I’m not going to lie– I was nervous and doubtful of myself and my abilities when starting in FinTech. But taking that action is a decision I do not regret. I am simultaneously working and learning and I am lucky to have a supportive team at Blankly that has helped me have a great experience so far. I am excited for what is to come and I hope to see more females at Blankly, and all FinTech companies, in the near future as we grow and become more influential.
