Happy December! As 2021 is coming to a close, we hope that everyone has had a great year. It has been an amazing journey for us as well. Founded early this year, Blankly was just an idea to transform the quantitative developer workflow. Now with active users and a growing community, we are excited to bring you more and more resources. Again, thank you for supporting us as we continue to expand in the years to come.

**UPDATES**

**We're excited to announce our acceptance into Z Fellows**, a one-week accelerator program for us to completely focus on Blankly and work alongside some incredible mentors, including the founders of Netflix, Figma, and Tinder. In addition, the program gives a $10,000 investment at a $1B valuation cap. This opportunity allows us to take the next huge step and accelerate our mission.
