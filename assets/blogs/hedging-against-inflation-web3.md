## Inflation is On the Rise

The annual inflation rate in the U.S. was reported to be 7.5% in January 2022, the highest since February of 1982. Various economic metrics like the Consumer Price Index showing how the same basket of goods and services is costing more and more. As the internet disseminates information faster than ever, consumers and investors are paying attention to prices of food, consumer goods, and oil prices skyrocket. Now as we look at the markets, as investors, it is becoming more and more important than ever to invest cash instead of holding it. As prices for goods increase during inflationary periods, cash just sitting around loses its purchasing power. Yet how do we beat 7.5% inflation? The stock market on average yields only 9.2% (only 2.5% above inflation)?  

Nevertheless, choosing the right places to invest your money is crucial. Fixed income securities like bonds and Certificates of Deposits are traditionally safe investment options as they provide a steady stream of income in the form of interest payments. However, because the rate of interest is oftentimes locked for fixed income securities until maturity, the purchasing power of the interest payments declines as inflation rises. Consequently, these assets tend to decrease in value during inflationary periods. The longer-term the bond, the more drastic the impact of inflation can be as cash flows received until maturity all lose value.

Don’t lose hope though! There are still a variety of investment opportunities that perform well during inflationary periods, both with traditional assets as well as Web 3.0 assets. Below are 8 key and innovative strategies to hedge against inflation.

*Disclaimer: Blankly does not intend this as direct investment advice. Invest at your own discretion.*

## Traditional Inflationary Hedges

### Real Estate

Real estate is a popular inflationary hedge as property values typically increase in-line with or above the inflation rate. Additionally, property owners can often increase rent payments during inflationary periods, generating higher income streams that offset the effects of inflation. As an investor, you can gain exposure to it by either buying real estate directly, or by buying shares of a real estate investment trust (REIT). Learn more about REITs [here](https://www.reit.com/).

### Commodities

Commodities ranging from gold and silver to oil to even oranges have historically been reliable ways to position for rising inflation. Inflation is oftentimes measured by tracking the price of goods and services (like in the case of the Consumer Price Index), which sometimes contain the commodities directly. In other cases like energy commodities and rare metals, the value of the communities have particularly strong correlations with inflation. Investors can purchase the commodity directly (generally in the case of rare metals) or invest in indices tracking the value of the commodity. Learn more about the Dow Jones Commodity Index [here](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/commodities/dow-jones-commodity-index/#overview).

### Bonds

While we just mentioned how many fixed income securities lose value during inflationary periods, a special type of bond known as inflation-indexed bonds are a safe hedge against inflation. These inflation-indexed bonds offer a variable interest rate tied to the inflation rate so that when the CPI rises, so does the interest paid on the bond. In the United States, [Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tips_glance.htm) are tied to the Consumer Price Index and are the most common way for investors to invest in inflation-indexed bonds.

### Stocks

Generally speaking, stocks have a reasonable chance of keeping pace of inflation, as the cash flows the underlying businesses bring in should increase with inflation. However, not all stocks are created equal. Similar to fixed income securities, stocks that pay out high dividends tend to depreciate during inflationary periods. Investors should look to invest in companies that are able to pass their rising input costs to either their consumers or suppliers.

## Web 3.0 Inflationary Hedges

### Cryptocurrency

Proponents of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have long asserted that cryptocurrencies, which are oftentimes known as the “Internet’s Gold,” are better hedges against inflation than real life rare metal. In a research article, J.P. Morgan reported that institutional investors are flocking to cryptocurrencies as a hedge against inflation. Investors wanting exposure to cryptocurrencies should check out exchanges like [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com) and [Binance](https://binance.com).

### Stablecoins

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose market value is pegged to the value of a certain asset. Popular stablecoins include [Binance USD](https://www.binance.com/en/busd) (BUSD) and [Tether](https://tether.to/en/) (USDT), which are backed on a 1:1 basis with the US Dollar. This means that one BUSD or USDT is the same as one dollar. How does that hedge against inflation? Well, anyone with an Internet connection can purchase a stablecoin that is tied to a less inflationary currency. For example, since inflation rates are currently lower in Europe, investors could hedge against inflation by purchasing [EURS](https://eurs.stasis.net/), the largest euro-backed stablecoin. 

### Staking

What’s even better than purchasing stablecoins and crypto is using your crypto to gain interest through a process called staking. Staking is like an interest account where they put your money to work by “validating transactions on the blockchain”. Because you’re powering the blockchain, you get a small cut, and oftentimes these rates are higher than inflation rates. 

### Yield Farming

Perhaps the most risky, but possibly rewarding, yield farming is an elevated version of staking which involves the focus on providing liquidity to various protocols. What are protocols? These are like the “exchanges” on the blockchain (similar to your brokerage). However, they rely on liquidity pools (people giving tokens), to supply the market with opportunities and trading (giving you a cut). Oftentimes, these yields are extremely high, paying extreme APYs that can ultimately lead to a big opportunity. But as the underlying asset moves, the APY may be completely erased (35% APY on a coin that went down -50% means a net loss of 15%). Thus, you would want to look at potentially yield farming stablecoins via protocols like [Celsius](https://celsius.network). 

There you have it 8 ways to hedge against inflation across Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. As you consider all of your options to diversify your portfolio, keep in mind that there is no “right” answer to how to allocate assets. Assets like commodities that perform well in inflationary periods do not produce any income, and have historically underperforming stocks and bonds over longer periods of time. Cryptocurrencies, although commonly viewed as inflationary hedges, have immense amounts of market risk and volatility associated with them. Always invest with caution, and carefully deliberate each investment decision.

## Now what about algotraders? 

As algorithmic traders, we are focused more on building trading strategies that ultimately make much higher returns per year. Thus inflation isn’t the most important factor and concerns. From this standpoint however, algorithmic trading that is doing longer-term investing (such as swing trading over months), might want to consider reducing their time horizons in order to take over some price fluctuations and opportunities in the short-term. Algotraders, especially in this volatile environment should also consider looking at [alternative data sources](https://https://www.quiverquant.com/) like macroeconomic events and [orderbook data](https://www.thebalance.com/order-book-level-2-market-data-and-depth-of-market-1031118) to help make the best decisions (as these types of data ultimately best indicate where price is going to move over technical indicators that will always lag). Now putting this into practice is much harder than you think: combining various data sources, rewriting code to a different resolution, wanting to potentially adapt and utilize crypto as an opportunity for algorithmic trading. Fortunately, we’ve [built out a system](https://blankly.finance) that allows you to rapidly adapt, build, and deploy active strategies and hedge against them using our [package](https://package.blankly.finance) and [platform](https://blankly.finance).
