title: "My First Week as a Blankly Developer"
description: Just a little blog post detailing what I've learned about the team since joining from week 1. It's been a lot of fun, a lot of grinding, but super exciting stuff. I can't wait to see where Blankly goes.

Hi there, I'm Mohnish, one of the devs on the Blankly team.

I first met Brandon at a local quant club at university, joining the team that he led within the club. I learned about Blankly through one of his educational sessions. Throughout the session, Brandon showed us how to create simple technical indicators through the [Blankly package](https://package.blankly.finance). The package was so smooth that it wasn’t until later that I learned how quickly it was made, and the team behind it. After the semester ended, Brandon invited me to work on building the platform.


After an onboarding session from Emerson and Jeremy, CTO and another dev on the team, I got to work. It took me little time to realize the work ethic of this team. Without a day’s rest, every developer on the team would work the entire day on building the platform, all after just completing finals week. Even on Christmas day, our zoom rooms were filled and our repos were constantly updating. Another thing that stood out was how supportive the other developers were. Emerson took his time to explain our backend pipeline and kubernetes (with diagrams that are frankly quite better than the developer docs). Brandon walked me through interacting with the database. And Jeremy was always able to hop on a zoom to talk through simple front end concepts. 

Finally, I was amazed at how ambitious and meticulous the team was. No one shied away from hard problems, and everyone paid close attention to minor details that we felt would improve the user experience.


My first week was filled with a lot of learning and a lot of fun. I look forward to many more!
