              relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use
              of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be

              affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,

              (b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before
              either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to
              the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing
              the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested
              relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 1917 1st Ave,
              Suite 200, Seattle, 98101, Washington. After the Notice is
              received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or
              dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the
              claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is
              received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The
              amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be
              disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has
              determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party
              is entitled.

              (c) Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the
              American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established
              alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that
              offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not
              available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an
              alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall
              govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited
              to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except
              to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA
              Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the
              arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the
              AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a
              single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total
              amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars
              (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding
              non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party
              seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of
              the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or
              more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration
              Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of
              the Company’s principal place of business, unless the parties
              agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator
              shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and
              place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by
              the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
              jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is
              greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to
              you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay
              you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear
              its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements
              arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the
              fees and costs of the ADR Provider.

              (d) Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If
              non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall
              be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written
              submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
              initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any
              personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise
              agreed by the parties.

              (e) Time Limits. If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the
              arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the
              statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a
              claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the
              pertinent claim.

              (f) Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the
              arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you
              and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any
              other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The
              arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive
              of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the
              authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary
              remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law,
              the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written
              award and statement of decision describing the essential findings
              and conclusions on which the award is based, including the
              calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same
              authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a
              court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and
              binding upon you and the Company.

              (g) Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR
              CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A
              TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all
              claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this
              Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more
              limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a
              court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the
              event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in
              any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an
              arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL
              RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be
              resolved by a judge.
