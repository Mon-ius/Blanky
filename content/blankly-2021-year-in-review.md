Founded in March this year, Blankly was nothing more than just a personal frustration. It was an attempt to improve and connect several API’s between crypto exchanges to trade on. Existing solutions were too limiting—we knew we wanted a powerful codebase, with the ability that enables quant developers to implement one trading algorithm that could be used to backtest and deploy to trade live.

Over the last nine months, Blankly has grown out of that attempt and now built into a fully-fledged open source [package](https://package.blankly.finance), a complete quant developer platform, and an API to connect and trade across all exchanges. As this is just the beginning, we are excited as to what holds in the near future, and how we can continue to support quant developers along their journey in algorithmic trading.

With that, here is everything we’ve done this year!

Finally, a last message from Brandon, our CEO:

Hey Blankly community, I just want to say how blessed I am to be on this journey with you all. Blankly started out of our own struggles of building trading algorithms and our desire to try to just “build”, not do everything else. It’s been a wild few months as we’ve seen our package grow from a little side project, to being used by so many different individuals with a wide variety of use cases. I’ve been able to talk to so many different individuals, see what they’re building, and why they’re excited for this, and can’t wait to see more and more individuals use our package and our many other products that are coming out to empower everyone from the hobbyist, to the hedge fund trading millions of dollars. We have a lot in store so stay tuned!

Thanks again,

Brandon Fan
