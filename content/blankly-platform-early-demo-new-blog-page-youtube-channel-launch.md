2022 is getting started underway, and it’s an exciting start for us here at Blankly. Development has been steady on both the [package](https://package.blankly.finance) and platform, everyone is working hard on writing helpful articles and blog posts, and things are in line with our plans moving forward into the new year. Thank you for all your support, and enjoy!

**UPDATES**

**This week, we’re starting off our Z Fellows program**, where we get to work 1-on-1 with some amazing mentors, chat with other start-up founders, and fully commit to working on Blankly. We’ll be sure to bring exciting new updates by the end of the week! Read more about it [here](https://blankly.finance/we-got-into-z-fellows).

**Our** [**Blankly Platform**](https://blankly.finance) **is fully up and running!** We’ve had some amazing user tests so far, which has given us great feedback as to what is successful and intuitive, and what can be improved. As always, we’re doing some more calls for our private beta to give you all a sneak peek into what we have and offer. We’d love to sit down for 30 to 45 minutes and see what you think about our platform so far. Sign up [here](https://calendly.com/blankly), and if you do, look out for a Blankly sticker and more offers on our premium plan when it comes out.

**We are also beginning to ramp up blog posts!** Head over to our new [blog page](https://blankly.finance/blog), where you can see all the posts we’ve had so far, and with much more to come in the future. There are resources from everything related to [developer marketing](https://blankly.finance/marketing-to-developers-is-difficult-but-rewarding) to [building your own Discord trading bot](https://blankly.finance/how-to-add-a-community-trading-bot-on-discord), and we’re excited to share more about our experiences. We are also constantly reposting our blogs over on different websites such as [reddit.com](http://reddit.com/) and [dev.to](http://dev.to/), so if you someday run into our resources there, go ahead and upvote, comment, so that more of the developer community can see what we’re up to.

If there are any other blog content that you would like to see, send us a message in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kS7Rk6knzU)! It’s been extremely active with new users coming in every day, and we would love to have you too.

**We started a Youtube channel!** Here, we’ll be posting videos geared for feature updates, playlists of different tutorials, webinars, and even live coding sessions. A few ideas we have are:

* Build with Blankly, where you follow us along in building something using our [Blankly package](https://github.com/Blankly-Finance/Blankly)
* Zero to Production, a series where we create from scratch a custom trading algorithm, perform backtests, and ultimately deploy to live production
* Fireside with Blankly, a live podcast production where we speak with different quant developers, students, and other leaders in the field
* “What Is…”, as we explain different quant and other trading concepts such as metrics, options, and more

Our first video is already out! Follow along with Brandon as he demonstrates how to build a working trading bot in just 25 lines of code, using the RSI indicator. Subscribe [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKAS1ATdeSLzv-ACUojwANA) for new videos every week!

**RESOURCES**

We’ve created a new public repo showcasing a simple crypto trading bot, where you can get started with using and understanding Blankly right away. Simply clone the repo onto your local directory, and watch how our [package](https://package.blankly.finance) works, switching between backtesting to live production with just one line of code.
