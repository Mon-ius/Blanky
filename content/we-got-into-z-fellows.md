We're excited to announce that we have gotten into [Z Fellows](https://www.zfellows.com/)! With an early-stage funding round of $10,000 and an amazing mentorship team, it'll enable us to pour into our Blankly community even more, and accelerate how we promote open-source collaboration along with building the end-to-end developer platform.

**Promote open-source collaboration**

From the beginning, we realized the value of open-source with the efforts and collaboration from developers all across the globe. Transparency is an important aspect in our workflow, and we believe it should be the same with our community as well. Our [Blankly Package](https://github.com/Blankly-Finance/Blankly) now has grown to over 400 stars on Github, forked by dozens of active developers to help build and create a resource for everyone to use. [Issues](https://github.com/Blankly-Finance/Blankly/issues) are constantly being updated on as members of the community bring up bugs, suggestions, and supportive feedback. We will continue to promote our open-source package and stay transparent as we are excited to work alongside everyone in our community.

**Build the end-to-end developer platform**

We're reimagining the quant workflow with our [Blankly Platform](https://blankly.finance). From enterprise-grade security to advanced analytics and monitoring, we want to build the best developer experience, where our infrastructure enables you to seamlessly integrate your code with our package, backtest in the cloud, and deploy your trading algorithms to production, all within seconds. Stay tuned for our early launch and beta release in the upcoming few weeks.

**Details**

[Z Fellows](https://www.zfellows.com/) is a one-week accelerator program founded by [Cory Levy](https://corylevy.com/), successful entrepreneur and early-stage investor.
