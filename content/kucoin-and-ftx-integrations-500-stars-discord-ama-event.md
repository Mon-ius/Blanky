Good morning! We hope everyone has had a great weekend. With $1.17 trillion [wiped from the crypto market](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/crypto-meltdown-erases-more-than-1-trillion-in-market-value?srnd=premium), maybe there were some algorithms out there that predicted the major sell-off. Over on our side, many things have begun to pick up speed, as we just wrapped up an amazing week with Z Fellows. Again, we would love to [set up a call and chat](https://calendly.com/blankly) with you (and you’ll receive some perks for our upcoming Platform). Enjoy! 

Happy trading,

The Blankly Team

More on the package, we’re now over 500 stars on Github! This isn’t a large number by any means, but it is still a very significant milestone for us.
