Hey there Blankly Community. It‚Äôs Brandon here to talk a little bit more about what we have in store for Blankly and some of the resolutions that we are making as a company. It‚Äôs been a wild 2021. With everyone battling COVID-19 in the workplace, life has been full of its ups and downs. 

Now, as we look past 2021, we head towards 2022. Blankly was founded in 2021 as a small little project, and has now grown to a full startup that is looking to reshape the way we do quantitative finance, putting the power into the builder and enabling individuals and hedge funds alike to rapidly build and deploy trading algorithms at scale in minutes instead of months. With this grand vision of mind, I want to introduce some new year's resolutions that we have as a team. Some are geared towards us as a company, others are geared towards how we work with you guys. Either way, we want to say that we are so proud to be on this mission with you guys and would absolutely love your feedback. If you have any, feel free to set up a call with us [here](https://calendly.com/blankly) and we‚Äôll be absolutely happy to hear your thoughts and how we can support you. 

## Cultivate and Propagate Our Developer Community

After talking to many members within the community, we‚Äôve realized how many times we have missed the mark on making specific items. Whether it‚Äôs been requiring keys, not enough documentation, or just hearing out what people are trying to build. Fundamentally, we are here for you guys, and our goal is to really cultivate a community of transparency when it comes to building our products (both free and paid), what we‚Äôre building, who we‚Äôre building for, and why we‚Äôre doing it. Cultivating a developer community for us and it‚Äôs important. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre imploring some of these things to kick off the next three months: 

- Set up and Facilitate 30 [Blankly Discovery Intro Calls](https://calendly.com/blankly)
- Set up and Facilitate 20 Usability Tests and Consults (Blankly Deep Dive)
- Write 40 [blog posts](https://blankly.finance/blog) by March related to tutorials, educational materials, state of quant, and the developer life.
- Have general team deliberations of ideas over discord and increased touch points with our users across platforms
- ‚ÄúI am a Blankly Contributor‚Äù Stickers and Merch for Founding Customers and Contributors to Blankly

## A Full-Scale Pipeline for Building, Backtesting, and Deployment

As many of you have already seen. We‚Äôve started showcasing some sneak peeks into our [early Blankly Platform](https://www.loom.com/share/bf64665a38d1469d9760a5120e0a149e): a tiered platform that enables individuals to rapidly build, backtest and deploy their models to the cloud, switching from backtesting to live in seconds instead of minutes, supporting people‚Äôs current workflows of developing locally all with the power of deployment monitoring, and a reimagined quant workflow. Our goal is to put the power for the builder. We‚Äôre empowering you guys as you build your strategies. 

In addition to our **[Blankly Platform](https://blankly.finance)**, we are building out more infrastructure for custom financial data and the many woes of data hosting, data management, API management, and connections with strategies and signals: our **Blankly Data** platform that is well in the works. Finally, we have more and more products that are looking to help you provide a more holistic view of all your assets and algorithms by consolidating them across exchanges, across asset classes, and providing you a nice view of your asset allocations, associated risk, and much more. If this excites you, *[join our Discord](https://discord.gg/xJAjGEAXNS)* so we can easily hear all of your thoughts and *[set up a call](https://calendly.com/blankly)* with us. So stay tuned for these products and be active in the community to help us build for you. 

## Build a Unified Blankly Brand Understanding

We built Blankly in an aspiration to unify exchanges. Now we‚Äôre expanding to unify all of quantitative finance: from model creation, to experimentation, to data, and to execution. Building a unified brand understanding comes in many ways for us. Whether it‚Äôs the way we conduct ourselves with open source, or the way we communicate our vision: we want to be known as a brand that supports developers and our community by listening to their concerns, being available for feedback, and driven by constant innovation to make the developer experience in quantitative finance the best it can be. How are we going to do this? 

- A greater focus on examples and documentation for more advanced use cases including Portfolio Allocation, Risk Management, Optimization, Platform Documentation, and More
- Greater emphases on opportunities for Open Source Contributions, Exchange Support, and Data Integrations
- Highlighting Contributions in the Community and Sharing of Core Values and Product roadmaps (In fact, check out our early [package roadmap](https://blankly.notion.site/a07253df7aa540a881be77dc9934a7fb?v=a3c97e9393c44510acb96619255e3f47) here, don't worry we have more in store)
- Providing clear relationships between products to enable an empowered workflow for the developer

Well, I hope that these resolutions that we have excite you because we‚Äôre so excited to keep building out our vision for Blankly of making the quantitative trading workflow accessible to all. if you haven‚Äôt already, *[join our Discord](https://discord.gg/xJAjGEAXNS)*, *star our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Blankly-Finance/Blankly)*, and *[subscribe to our Substack newsletter](https://blankly.substack.com/)*. I‚Äôm super stoked, and I really can‚Äôt wait to see what you all do with the package this year. For us, the biggest help we can get is your feedback and you sharing this product with more of your friends in the quant community. Your problems are many people‚Äôs problems, so please continue to let us know what they are. Thanks again for all your help and support. And thanks for Building with Blankly üò∂ üöÄ.

Cheers,

Brandon Fan
*CEO and Cofounder*
