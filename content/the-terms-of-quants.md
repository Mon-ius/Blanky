There are so many terms that go around when describing the quant world that it often makes it difficult to fully understand what’s going on or what quants really do. We’ve carefully done our research and broken it down. Here’s a couple we’ve found to better understand positions in the quant industry.

## Quantitative analysis

[Quantitative analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitativeanalysis.asp) in finance is the use of mathematical models to analyze markets and securities. Oftentimes this analysis is used to either price derivative securities or minimize risk and optimize returns. Individuals working in this field are oftentimes referred to as quantitative analysts or “quants” for short. 

## Risk Management quants

The area of [risk management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskmanagement.asp) quant has grown in recent years after the financial crisis exposed issues in how certain positions were hedged. Risk management quants help traders by analyzing the risk on various securities and markets using techniques such as value at risk (VaR) to measure the risk of loss on a group of assets. 

## Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic traders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/algorithmictrading.asp) use highly complex mathematical models to develop and maintain algorithms that can automatically trade assets at a predetermined price and time. Because of the knowledge required for this position they are often the highest paid quants in the industry. 

## Front office quantitative analyst

[Front office quants](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/121615/quantitative-analyst-job-description-average-salary.asp) determine prices, manage risk and look for new investment opportunities. In general they are working on the front office lines with traders on the trading floor. While they are very similar to algorithmic trading quants, FOQs favor speed over quality and they are more focused in finding specific solutions to problems rather than creating detailed models to solve them. 

## Investment/asset management quant

[Asset management firms](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset_management_company.asp) use quants to help assist in risk management and develop quantitative strategies that are either used exclusively to trade or used alongside qualitative and fundamental methods to manage assets. 

## Library quantitative analyst

[Library quants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(finance)#Library_quantitative_analysis) develop standardized methods to evaluating prices and risk. They spend a lot of time modelsing to ensure that the analytics are efficient and correct. 

## Quantitative developer

[Quant developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(finance)#Quantitative_developer) are generally computer specialists that implement and maintain the quantitative models. They have specialized knowledge in coding and computer programming to develop these models. They bridge the gap between software engineers and quant analysts.
